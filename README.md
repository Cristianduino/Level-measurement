Differential Pressure Level Measurement

There are fundamentally two ways to measure level of a fluid in a vessel, which are:
Direct level measurement
Inferential level measurement
Float, magnetostrictive, retracting, capacitance, radar, ultrasonic and laser level measurement falls under direct level measurement technique, whereas weight and differential pressure level measurement comes under inferential level measurement technology.
Differential pressure level sensors or Differential pressure transmitters are probably the most widely employed devices for the purpose of level detection. â€œUsing DP for level is really an inferential measurement. A DP is used to transmit the head pressure that the diaphragm senses due to the height of the material in the vessel multiplied by a density variable.

Differential pressure level measurement technique makes use of a differential pressure detector which is installed at the bottom of the tank whose level is to be detected. The liquid inside the tank creates pressure which is comparatively higher than the reference atmospheric pressure. This pressure comparison is performed via the Differential pressure detector. A standard differential pressure transmitter connected to an open tank is shown in the figure below.

In case of open tanks i.e. tanks which are open to the atmosphere, only high pressure ends of the DP transmitter is needed to be connected whereas the low pressure end of the DP transmitter is expelled into the atmosphere. Hence, the differential pressure happens to be the hydrostatic head or weight of the fluid contained in the tank. 
The highest level detected by the differential pressure transmitter usually depends upon the maximum height of fluid above the transmitter, whereas the lowest level detected is based upon the position where the transmitter is attached to the tank or vessel. 
Now, in cases where tanks or vessels are not open to the atmosphere i.e. in pressurized tanks, both the high and low pressure ends of the differential pressure detector are required to be connected. These tanks are entirely covered in order to avoid release of vapors or steam outside. Due to this, the liquid inside the tank gets pressurized.
